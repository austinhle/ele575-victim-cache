# ELE 575 Spring 2018 Final Project: Victim Caches in OpenPiton

Implementing Victim Caches in OpenPiton.

This repository contains our modifications to the [OpenPiton](http://parallel.princeton.edu/openpiton/index.html) framework with custom files for a victim cache in between the L1.5 and L2 caches in the original chipset. OpenPiton is an open-source, multithreaded, manycore processor capable of running Linux, designed by the Parallel Computing group at Princeton University.

This project was originally created by [Austin Le](austinle@cs.princeton.edu) and [Chirag Bharadwaj](chiragb@cs.princeton.edu) for their final project in [ELE 575: Advanced Computer Architecture](http://eleclass.princeton.edu/classes/ele475/spring_2018/doku.php) at [Princeton University](https://ee.princeton.edu) in Spring 2018.
